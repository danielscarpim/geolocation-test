# GeoLocation Test #

### Compiling ###
This project uses Foundation 6. I included the compiled files in the repository inside the dist folder. 
To recomplile, just run:

* npm install
* bower install
* foundation watch

### Testing ###
Sorry, there is no testing. This is one of the things I don't really know yet and I didn't have time to learn it for this project.

### JS Libraries Used ###
* Angular.js
* jQuery.


### Observations ###
The only time I had available to work on this project was yesterday (Feb. 01). So I missed some important features that were asked.

* Testing.
* Form validation.

Overall, the code works and I'm happy with the result. I think I could optimize it a little more to make it more modular, but that's all I had time to do really.
